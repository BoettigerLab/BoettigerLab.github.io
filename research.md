In order to study the 3D DNA structures which regulate contacts between cis-regulatory elements (CREs) and their target transcribed elements (TEs), we are developing a super-resolution imaging approaches capable of resolving tens to hundreds of individual CREs, TEs, and intervening sequence in single cells of sectioned embryonic tissue and cultured cells at better than 20 nm resolution. We are applying this approach first to a selection of well-studied loci from Drosophila embryos and vertebrate cultured-cells, where the CREs have been mapped and the TEs they regulate identified through prior extensive genetic work. By observing the higher order structure of these loci in both wildtype and mutant conditions and in distinct cell-types that differ in TE expression at the locus, we aim to identify general principles that regulate physical interactions and shape expression. We plan to combine these experiments with simultaneous imaging of nascent RNA and mature transcripts in single cells, to determine which physical structures promote and which impede gene expression. We will also plan to use genetic manipulations and interspecies comparison of CREs to understand the sequence variation within and between species that result in phenotypic variation of key traits such as facial features and disease susceptibility.
